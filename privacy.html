No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year following the last interaction you have with our Website or Services.<br>
			When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br>
			<br>
			<b>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</b><br>
			<br>
			<i><b>In Short:</b> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i><br>
			We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kosai.com">privacy@kosai.com</a>.<br>
			<br>
			<b>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</b><br>
			<br>
			<i><b>In Short:</b> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area ("EEA") and United Kingdom ("UK"), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</i><br>
			In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right: (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information; (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kosai.com">privacy@kosai.com</a>. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.<br>
			If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br>
			If you are a resident in the EEA and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.<br>

			<b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Website.<br>
			<br>
			<b>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK</b><br>
			<br>
			Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. As of the effective date of this privacy notice, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.<br>
			<br>

			You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.<br>

			Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights<br>
			We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.<br>
			Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.<br>
			We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.<br>
			Other privacy rights<br>
			You may object to the processing of your personal data.<br>
			You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the data.<br>
			You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.<br>
			You may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the request submission.<br>
			To exercise these rights, you can contact <a href="mailto:privacy@kosai.com">privacy@kosai.com</a> or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.<br>
